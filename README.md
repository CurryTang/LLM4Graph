## LLM4Graph: A library for applying LLMs for graph foundation model development


Ongoing project: a library for graph foundation model


### Roadmap 

#### v0.1: support data loading

Node-level dataset:

** Homophily**

- [x] Cora, CiteSeer, Pubmed
- [x] WikiCS
- [x] Arxiv, Products
- [] CoraFull
- [] Arxiv-2023

** Heterophily**
- [] Arxiv-year
- [] Amazon Ratings

Graph-level dataset:

- [] Open Graph Benchmark




#### v0.2: models

Instead of implementing detailed models(some typical ones will be included in examples), we will implement some common patterns

- [] Graph prompts
- [] Multi-modal instruction tuning
- [] Iterative training
- [] link prediction as auxiliary tasks
